# Work-Samples

## Capstone - Time Series Forecasting ##
I apply machine and deep learning models - including multiple linear regression, random forest regression, LSTM, and XGBoost - to a time series dataset to forecast values three time steps in the future.  I explain the theory behind each model and explore the results and their implications.

## Deep Learning Project ##
I build a convolutional neural network to classify three sets of images.

## Machine Learning Project ##
I built a linear regression and random forest regression model to predict user income from a cursor flow dataset.

## Business Simulation Project ##
I use the Harvard Business Publishing simulator to analyze annual company data and build a business strategy over a period of four years.

## Disruptive Thinking and Business Analysis ##
An essay on disruption and a Business Analyst's role in developing a disruptive strategy

## Change Management and Creative Thinking ##
A presentation on how to manage change and foster creative thinking in the workplace
